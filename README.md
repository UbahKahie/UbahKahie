    <p>#100DaysOfCode Challenge</p>
    <p>Day 1: 

I'm thrilled to be part of the 100days of coding challenge. It's a great motivator for me to learn new skills and practice through project creation. After completing a SheCode Basic course, I've started working on small projects to build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. Even though this is my first experience with coding and tools like VS Code Studio, I've come to understand the significance of HTML and CSS in shaping the structure of web pages. I have worked on a simple weather app display page which could be found in the repository called [UbahKahie/WeatherAppZanzibar](https://github.com/UbahKahie/WeatherAppZanzibar), using basic HTML and CSS.

Day 2:

To further my understanding of HTML and CSS, I embarked on the creation of a website landing page. This endeavour served as a valuable opportunity to reinforce my grasp of the fundamental principles of HTML and CSS, as these technologies form the core structure of a landing page project titled 'UbahKahie/Visit-Cappadocia.'

I have also started a new journey with the School of Code. I delved into the pivotal concepts of Computational Thinking and Growth Mindset, and why this is vital. We explored foundational principles and worked on practical exercises that involved experimenting with CSS techniques, one involved immersing myself in the world of CSS through an interactive project known as the 'CSS Garden.'

Day 3:

Exploring agile

Today, I learned about Agile and its methodology, which emphasises flexibility and collaboration in project management. Additionally, I had my first experience with Git and GitHub, it was challenging at first, however I quickly realised the significance of GitHub as a workspace for code collaboration and version control. I also learned how to use essential Git commands like 'git add .' to stage changes and 'git commit -m' to save changes with a descriptive message. Git and GitHub play a crucial role in software development by enabling efficient code management and teamwork, and mastering these tools is essential for effective collaboration. 

Day 4: 

Today, I regrasped my knowledge of HTML and CSS by thoroughly reading through the Intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project. This comprehensive resource provided valuable insights into these fundamental web development technologies.

In addition, during my School of Code session, I dived into the fundamentals of JavaScript and its importance in web development. Within my team, we explored variables and data types, including the use of 'let', ‚Äòvar‚Äô 'const' for variable declaration. Furthermore, we delved into coding logical operators to evaluate and present true or false statements. This hands-on practice with JavaScript laid the groundwork for understanding its role in creating dynamic and interactive web applications."

Day 5: 

Today I practised while loops and for loops in Java Script. These loop structures are vital because they allow us to automate repetitive tasks and efficiently process data.

By practicing coding exercises involving while and for loops, I gained a deeper understanding of how to use them to iterate through codes. These skills are crucial for writing efficient code. 

Day 6:

Through the SoC, we  focused on learning about arrays in JavaScript and practiced working with them. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, and understanding them is important because they enable us to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

I explored various aspects of arrays, including creating them, adding and removing elements, accessing specific items, and using array methods to perform operations like sorting and filtering. 

Day 7:

Today, I focused on learning about JavaScript objects and engaged in hands-on practice to solidify my understanding with the SoC. 

During my learning session, we explored creating objects, adding properties and methods, and accessing their values. I also practiced using objects to organise and manipulate data in a structured manner. </p>
